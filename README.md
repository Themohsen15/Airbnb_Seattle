# Introduction

# Airbnb_Seattle
## Airbnb Seattle dataset analysis and machine learning models.


### We have Airbnb Seattle data of the listings, calendar of bookings, and reviews of guests. Those data were recorded from the beginning of 2016 until January 2017 (listings and calendars), while review data were recorded from 2010 until the end of 2015.

## This project answered four questions:

### 1- Which month has the highest number of bookings?
### 2- Which features have the highest impact on prices?
### 3- Which Amenities are the most important?
### 4- Can we tell if a reviewer is being unfair?

### Also, it included a machine learning models that aimed to predict the price of listings.


# Liburaries:



#### numpy ... for adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
#### pandas ... for data manipulation and analysis.


#### matplotlib ... for plotting and graphing
#### seaborn ... for plotting and graphing 


#### sklearn.linear_model  ... for linear models for machine learning
#### sklearn.ensemble ... for decision trees models for machine learning



#### sklearn.model_selection ... for preparing data for machine learning models
#### sklearn.metrics ... for evaluating the results of machine learning models


# File describtions:

### 1 - AirBnb.ipynb: A jupyter notebook that has the project functional detailes (Data preperation, modeling, and findings)
### 2 - datasets.zip: A zipped file that has the three datasets used in the notebook (listings.csv, calendar.csv, and reviews.csv)


# Results
### We analyzed the given Airbnb Seattle datasets which are Listings, Calendar of bookings, and Reviews. We found the months that have the highest number of bookings, the features that have the most significant impact on listings prices, the amenities that have the most significant impact on listings prices, and finally, we analyzed the reviews data to find out how many reviewers can be considered as unfair. Also we crated a great machine learning model that can predict listings prices with great accuracy.

### I must give credit for kaggle since they are the onse who published the datasets used in the project. Also I would like to acknowledge Udacity for helping me with the understanding of the process of any Data Science project.
